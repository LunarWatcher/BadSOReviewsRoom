# Review resources

This document contains resources for the various queues, primarily targeted at how to review correctly (and consequently, that can be used to identify bad reviews).

Note that there's two subcategories not directly associated with one, specificq ueue, but that applies to several queues.

If you still have questions, or can't find what you're looking for, feel free to ask [in chat](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/208985/bad-stack-overflow-reviews)
