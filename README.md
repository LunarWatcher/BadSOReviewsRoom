# Bad Stack Overflow reviews

This repo contains various meta information for [this room on chat.SO](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/208985/bad-stack-overflow-reviews).

## Requests

Requests can include the actual and expected actions in the queue, but don't have to. If you decide to include expected and actual reviews, do it in this format (without brackets):

```
[actual, bad review] [expected review] [link to review]
```

The review doesn't have to overall have been mishandled, though some discression can and will be applied to certain reviews. This does also include tag wiki plagiarism, but to a substantially lesser degree.

### Current focus

At this time, there's no prioritized reviews; everything can be posted.

That said, if you stumble over:
* Suggested edits that _add_ fluff, or add a tagline including the _editor's_ username (regardless of whether the consensus is to approve). There's 20+ users who have submitted these and counting, and the volume and a few other details makes these edits part of a wave.
* An approval on tag wiki plagiarism (regardless of whether the consensus is to approve) -- it's time to crack down on tag wiki plagiarism.

Then please consider reporting even if it isn't a pattern.
